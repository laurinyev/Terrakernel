# The Terrakernel Project
## Made for Terra

Terrakernel is a hybrid x86_64 kernel.

During the development of TK the kernel will always be on version v1.0-rc0.
Terra is the operating system I'm planning to use terrakernel for.

# TODO
*: WIP

### Initial stuff
- [x] Port printf implementation
- [x] Support for some COM1 serial output using port 0x3F8
- [x] End of initial stuff

### x86_64 Specific
- [x] Write a GDT
- [x] Write an IDT
- [x] Write a physical memory manager
- [x] Write a virtual memory manager
- [x] Write a heap
- [x] Write a PIT timer
- [x] Switch to fully graphical (flanterm) messages and logs
- [x] Port uACPI
- [x] (Other) Write a VFS and TMPFS and parse a USTAR Initrd archive
- [ ] Scheduling and multithreading (delayed)
- [x] Switching to userspace
- [ ] Write some basic syscalls
- [ ] Load x86_64 ELF binaries, static and relocatable (copy from old version of TK) (delayed)
- [ ] End of x86_64 stuff (almost) (delayed)

### Other
- [x] Write a VFS and TMPFS and parse a USTAR Initrd archive
- [x] Add support for /dev/XYZ files (use O_BUILTIN_DEVICE_FILE in kernel, also requires an additional parameter which is devpath, the path to the device directory, usually for disks, e.g., initrd creates two nodes, /dev/initrd (initrd disk image) and /initrd the directory itself)
- [x] Write a PCI driver (PCIe as well)
- [x] Write a PS2 keyboard driver
- [x] Line discipline
- [ ] Try to write an XHCI driver for USB device support
- [ ] Write some disk drivers, probably AHCI only for now*
- [ ] Some filesystem drivers, probably FAT32 and maybe, maybe, maybe EXT3 or EXT4
- [ ] End of other

### Porting software
- [ ] Port binutils and coreutils
- [ ] Port DOOM
- [ ] Port a window manager (window server) (probably Xorg)
- [ ] Port anything else
- [ ] End of porting software
- [ ] End of project... or at least this version...

### Building the kernel

### How many LoC?

```x86asm
     139 text files.
     136 unique files.
       3 files ignored.
